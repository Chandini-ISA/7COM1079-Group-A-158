This project investigates whether mileage is significantly correlated with the resale price of used BMW cars in the UK. Using dataset DS0, we cleaned 10,001 listings, removed outliers, and prepared a reliable working dataset. The analysis was performed in R, including Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and linear regression to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship. Two required visualisations were produced: a scatterplot of price versus mileage and a histogram of mileage. All cleaning steps, plots, and statistical outputs were generated through scripts/Analysis.R. The project was collaboratively developed using GitHub for version control.









Gopi: Performed minor repo cleanup by removing temporary files and ensuring folder structure documentation is up to date.



Santosh: Cleaned outdated instructions from README and added clear steps on how to run scripts/Analysis.R.



Vikas: Added guidance on using .gitignore for large temporary files and clarified which outputs should not be tracked.
