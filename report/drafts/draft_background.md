section 2.1 - Several studies have examined factors that influence used-car depreciation, consistently identifying mileage as a key determinant of market value. Bhatt and Chu (2017) analysed over 20,000 used vehicles and reported that mileage had one of the strongest negative effects on resale prices, with depreciation accelerating for high-mileage cars. Similarly, Levay et al. (2021) used a European dataset and found that usage-based indicators such as mileage explained a substantial proportion of price variation, outperforming cosmetic or optional features. Both studies highlight the robustness of mileage as a predictor across brands and segments.



Industry-level research supports these findings. A large-scale valuation report by CAP HPI (2020), widely used in the UK automotive sector, shows that each additional mile contributes directly to vehicle depreciation, with higher mileage bands producing disproportionately larger price drops due to perceived wear and reduced reliability. The consistency across academic and industry evidence strengthens the expectation that mileage should exhibit a negative and statistically significant relationship with resale value. These studies collectively justify investigating this relationship specifically within the BMW segment of the UK used-car market.





section 2.2 - Although previous studies consistently show that mileage affects used-car prices, most research focuses on mixed-brand datasets or broad market averages. Limited work examines a single manufacturer, particularly premium brands such as BMW, where depreciation profiles differ due to engineering characteristics, model hierarchy, and brand-specific buyer expectations. Furthermore, existing studies rarely compare raw industry assumptions with statistical evidence derived from real resale listings. This creates a gap in understanding how strongly mileage predicts price specifically within BMW vehicles in the UK market. Addressing this gap helps evaluate whether general depreciation patterns apply consistently to a premium brand.
