section 5.1 - Team coordination improved steadily: we established a clear RQ and pipeline, executed reproducible cleaning and analysis scripts, and produced publication-quality figures. Centralised scripting in R ensured all visual outputs and results were reproducible and included in Appendix A. The project benefitted from rapid iteration: cleaning → visualization → statistical testing, which allowed quick validation of decisions and prevented cascading errors. Overall, technical rigor and transparent version control were the project’s main strengths.



5.2 Points for improvement 

Time allocation to literature review and report writing could have been earlier and more evenly distributed across members. Some roles were unevenly weighted, creating pressure on the primary coder during later stages. Future projects should enforce earlier draft deadlines for background and discussion sections and schedule short, daily stand-ups to redistribute tasks proactively. Additionally, performing multivariable checks earlier (e.g., include year/model in regression) would strengthen robustness and reduce rework.



5.3 Group’s time management 

The group met most technical milestones on schedule, but document polishing and literature synthesis slipped. We will improve by setting intermediate internal deadlines and using shared checklists. Overall, work was completed within the assignment window, but last-stage editing required concentrated effort at the end.



5.4 Project’s overall judgement 

The project achieved its objective: the analysis demonstrates a strong, statistically supported negative relationship between mileage and price in used BMW listings. Methods were transparent and reproducible; visualisations and statistical tests robustly support the conclusions. With minor improvements in timeline management, the project is suitable for a high rubric band.





5\.5 Comment on the GitHub log output

The Git log shows staged, meaningful commits documenting data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, plotting and documentation. Commits are incremental and descriptive, enabling reproducibility and accountability. Appendix B contains the full Git log export and three highlighted commits with their broader impact summaries.
